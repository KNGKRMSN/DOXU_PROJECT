Thank you for adquiring the first Shader I've ever uploaded
To use this shader, you'll have 5 scripts available


shader_sincity_start(); - Starts the shader with the default values

shader_sincity_start_extended(contrast, saturation, blue_threshold, green_threshold, red_min_threshold); 
This one starts the shader but you'll have to send each parameter as a float value. This is the recommended option.

shader_sincity_pause(); - Pauses the shader

shader_sincity_resume(); - Resumes the paused shader

shader_sincity_stop(enable_surface_draw?); - Deletes the shader entirely. You have choose wether you want to
enable application_surface_draw again or not.
